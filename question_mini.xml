I can't see a way to do so with triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we're after looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;| &gt; &gt; &gt; |&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And the visibility of TabItems are determined by binding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do have it working in code.  On TabItem visibility changed, enumerate through TabItems until you find the first visible one.  Set the style on that one.  For all other visible TabItems, set them to the pointy style (so that the previously first visible one is now pointy).  Then start from the end until you find a visible TabItem and set the last style on that one.  (This also lets us address an issue with TabControl where it will display the content of a non-visible TabItem if none of the visible TabItems are selected.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's undoubtably improvements I could make to my method, but I'm not convinced that it IS the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How would you approach this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28074" LastEditorUserId="66708" LastEditorDisplayName="Jexia" LastEditDate="2010-10-15T00:37:22.290" LastActivityDate="2013-02-06T17:45:43.123" Title="Setting style on first and last visible TabItem of TabControl" Tags="&lt;.net&gt;&lt;wpf&gt;&lt;xaml&gt;&lt;tabcontrol&gt;&lt;tabitem&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="2" FavoriteCount="1" />
